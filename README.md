Hilo is a game in which a card is drawn with a number between 1 and 13
the player then guesses if the next card will be higher or lower than 
the first card. The player begins with 300 points, and if the player 
guesses correctly, then they gain 100 points. If they guess incorrectly,
then they lose 75 points.
 
 In this program I attempt to build an automated card drawer from a deck
 of 13 cards, each with a unique number on it from 1 to 13. This project
 draws a card, asks the player to guess, then also adds or subtracts 
 points according to the rules of the game and keeps track of the players
 score at the end of each round. 
 If the player reaches 0 points, then the program would terminate, as 
 a score of 0 ends the game.
